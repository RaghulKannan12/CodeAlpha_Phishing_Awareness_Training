Phishing awareness training is an educational program designed to equip individuals and organizations with the knowledge and skills needed to identify, avoid, and respond to phishing attacks. This training typically includes modules on recognizing common phishing tactics, such as deceptive emails and fraudulent websites, understanding the psychological manipulation techniques used by attackers, and following best practices for safeguarding sensitive information. Participants learn how to verify the legitimacy of communications, report suspicious activities, and implement preventative measures to protect personal and organizational data. Through interactive simulations, real-world examples, and continuous updates on emerging threats, phishing awareness training aims to foster a security-conscious culture and enhance overall cyber resilience.
